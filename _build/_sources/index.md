*Notes I wish I had showed me when I started*

This collection of notes pretty much is a my consolidated experience in the field of computational chemistry. Some I found through trial and error, while others are from the exceptional guidance of Dr. Genwei Zhang, Dr. Zheng Pei, Dr. Xiaoliang Pan, and Dr. Yihan Shao.

I am not the most coherent when it comes to speaking and writing, but I hope many of you will find this information useful in your future endeavors.


**These notes include tips, tricks, and examples for:**

I have read the Amber manual so much.... It would be a waste not to summarize them here. I also wrote a set of tutorials for Amber simulations in the worflow our lab takes.

* Classical Molecular Dynamics Simulations
* Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics Simulations
