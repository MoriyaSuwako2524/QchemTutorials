*Notes I wish I had showed me when I started*

This collection of notes pretty much is a my consolidated experience in the field of computational chemistry. Some I found through trial and error, while others are from the exceptional guidance of Dr. Genwei Zhang, Dr. Zheng Pei, Dr. Xiaoliang Pan, and Dr. Yihan Shao.

I am not the most coherent when it comes to speaking and writing, but I hope many of you will find this information useful in your future endeavors.

Softwares I often use:
   * [IQmol](http://iqmol.org)
   * [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/) 
   * [VMD]( https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)
   * [ChemDraw](https://connect.revvitysignals.com/sitesubscription/Gallery.aspx)
   * [Schrodinger Maestro](https://www.schrodinger.com/products/maestro)






**Simulations with [AmberMD](http://ambermd.org)**

I have read the Amber manual so much.... It would be a waste not to summarize them here. I also wrote a set of tutorials for Amber simulations in the worflow our lab takes.

   * Classical Molecular Dynamics Simulations
   * Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics Simulations



**Cloud-Based Websitess**

Neat websites I learned about during my Ph.D!
* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) 
  * Equations, tables, and writing manuscripits with $\LaTeX$
* [GitHub](https://github.com) 
  * Public code repositories, and lab resources!
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
  * Accessible notebooks for coding
  


**and other fun activities**
    
* Like making this website with Jekyll or JupyterBook ðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª
