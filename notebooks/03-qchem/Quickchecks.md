### Linear algebra

I recommend the book <<Linear Algebra Done right>>. Which is great to learn Linear Algebra

Some questions that you can think to quickly check either you still need to learn linear algebra:

1. What is a **Vector Space** and a **Subspace**?
2. What is the **basis** and the **dimension** of a vector space? What's the dimension of Hilbert space in quantum mechanics?
3. What is the relation between **linear map**, **operator** and **matrix**?
4. What is **orthogonal** and **orthonormal**?
5.
