Minimization input file in explicit solvent
 &cntrl
  ! Minimization options
  imin=1         ! Turn on minimization
  maxcyc=2000,   !  Maximum number of minimization cycles
  ncyc=1000,     ! Steepest-descent steps, better for strained systems       

  ! Potential energy function options
  cut=8.0,       ! nonbonded cutoff, in angstroms
 
  ! Control how often information is printed to the output file
  ntpr=100,      ! Print energies every 100 steps
